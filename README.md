## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

I probably have written some of the worst code in history in this. But - I really wanted to work more with JS even though I basically knew this could almost all be done better with CSS.
